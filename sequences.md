# Day 3/100: Python Challenge! ðŸš€

Welcome to **Day 3** of my 100-day Python challenge! ðŸŽ‰  
Today, I dove into the world of **sequences** in Python, exploring **lists**, **tuples**, **strings**, and **ranges**. These core concepts are essential for handling collections of data and making the most of Python's powerful features. Letâ€™s get into the details!

---

### **Sequences**
A **sequence** is an ordered collection of items. In Python, the main types of sequences include:

- **Lists**: Ordered and **mutable** collections.
- **Tuples**: Ordered and **immutable** collections.
- **Strings**: Ordered collections of **characters**.
- **Ranges**: Immutable sequences of **numbers**.

---

### **1. Lists**
- Lists are ordered, **mutable** collections of items.
- You can store different data types in a list.

### **2. Tuples**
- Tuples are ordered and **immutable** collections.
- Unlike lists, you cannot change a tuple after itâ€™s created.
- Useful for storing data that **should not** be modified.

### **3. Strings**
- Strings are ordered collections of characters.
- Strings in Python are **immutable**, just like tuples.
- Used for **storing text**.

### **4. Ranges**
- Ranges generate a sequence of numbers.
- Often used in **loops** for iteration.

---

### **5. Checking for Item Presence in Sequences**
- You can check if an item exists in a sequence using `in` or `not in`.

---

### **6. List Concatenation and Repetition**
- **Concatenation**: Combine two lists using `+`.
- **Repetition**: Repeat a list using `*`.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- Sequences help in handling collections of data in an organized way.
- **Lists**, **tuples**, **strings**, and **ranges** are the main sequence types in Python.
- Operations like **concatenation**, **repetition**, and checking for the presence of elements are fundamental for sequence manipulation.

### **Conclusion**
Today was a fantastic dive into **sequences**! Iâ€™ve learned the core concepts of **lists**, **tuples**, **strings**, and **ranges**, along with essential operations for working with these sequences. With these tools, Iâ€™m well-equipped to handle collections of data in Python.

Canâ€™t wait for **Day 4** as I continue this exciting learning journey! Letâ€™s keep the momentum going! ðŸ’»âœ¨
